## 2026-10-21 07:10 — v0 foundation
- Built: economy (castles assign pilgrims to depots within 6 king steps, churches pioneered at remote clusters we
  are nearer to), checkerboard prophet lattice, defenders on sight, castle attack, attack waves at 20 units, endgame
  crusader dump (HP tiebreak), symmetry from map, enemy castles = mirrors of ours (castle talk shares positions).
- First game (seed 2 vs example, driver): won on health 9650 vs 480. Basics: 0 friendly damage, 0 invalid actions,
  karbonite floated above 400 in 100% of rounds 100-900 (5,400 K at round 950). Only 9 pilgrims: this map has 18
  depots and we held our 9.
- Seed 5 on the VM: one castle "Took too long to initialize" (cold vm2 in a loaded process) and the game was lost on
  castle count. Fix in the harness: the runner warms up vm2 before round 1 and reports init_ms_max.
- Next: v1 production (guard prophets, surplus to crusaders) to remove the float; measure v0 vs example on 12 seeds.

## 2026-10-21 (session 2) — v1 snapshot, v2 rewrite in a canonical frame
- v1 = the previous working copy (guard prophets, surplus crusaders), frozen as bots/v1.
- v2: rewrite around src/bot/world.js. Each robot sees its own side on top; decisions never use ids, team colour or
  the engine's visible-list order. Minified single-file build (22 KB) to keep init inside the 100 ms clock.
- symcheck (self-play, twin-paired action application): seeds 2, 7, 21 exact mirror for 200 rounds; other seeds
  diverge only at mirror-axis contests or after the first attack (engine turn order). One real asymmetry source fixed:
  robots born on the same tile shared a random stream (now reseeded with the birth round).
- v2 vs example: 20/20 wins (4 by castle count at round 1000, 16 by annihilation near round 470).
- v2 vs v1: 5/10 at timescale 1 (heavy init failures on both sides under VM load 12), 4/6 at timescale 2.
  Losses: the single castle falls while the army is away; fuel runs dry (fuel 20, karbonite 1,595 floating) because
  movement burned 18,000 fuel. Movement fuel is r2 x fuel/move, so short steps are cheaper per tile.
- Candidates: h1 = r2 <= 2 cruise steps, fuel-aware depot choice and military reserve; h2 = h1 + 30% home guard
  that ignores attack orders before round 900, and per-robot RNG reseeded by birth round.
